# downscaleCMIP6-binder-env

Very basic build environment for downscaleCMIP6 binder notebooks

* environment.yml - conda compute environment spec
* postBuild - configures Markdown Preview as the default markdown viewer rather than Editor - this allows us to use markdown files for navigation like a website within the binder deployment
